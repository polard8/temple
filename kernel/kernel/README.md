# kernel - The kernel.

This is code for the base kernel. It builds the image KERNEL.BIN.


## Folders

```
arch    - Entry point and initialization.
core    - Core components and Control resources layer.
include - Main header files for the kernel.
kres    - Kernel resources layer.
your    - Stuff
```

## About core/ folder:

```
  It is basically for CPU and process stuff.
```

## About kres/ folder:

```
  Based on the idea that we need to control the kernel resourses used 
by the process groups, we put all these resources into a single folder called kres/. 

  So the core/ folder needs to control the access to theses resources 
inside the kres/ folder.
  mm/ is also considered a resource, so the right place for this compiment is inside kres/ 
not as a core/ component.
```
