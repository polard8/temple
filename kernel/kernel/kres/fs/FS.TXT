
 There is some special representation of folder name. It makes
easy for the file system to find the file in the given pathname.

'#TEST.TXT' is the representation of the pathname '/DE/TEXT.TXT'
'@TEST.TXT' is the representation of the pathname '/GRAMADO/TEXT.TXT'

Probably this system will have some reserved names for the standard devices.
Just like, '/NULL' or '/RANDOM'
