==================================================================

The file `zcore/kernel/kres/mm/x86_64/x64gva.h` defines various virtual addresses 
used by the kernel's memory manager. Here are some considerations based on 
the defined virtual addresses:

1. **Low Memory Regions (below 1MB):**
   - **MBR and VBR Addresses (0x600, 0x800)**: Virtual addresses for the Master Boot Record and Volume Boot Records. These addresses are mapped directly to physical addresses and are crucial for the boot process.
   - **FAT and Root Directory Addresses (0x00030000, 0x00070000)**: Virtual addresses for the file allocation table and root directory for storage volumes.

2. **Kernel Memory Regions:**
   - **Kernel PML4 Address (0x000000000009C000)**: Virtual address for the kernel's Page Map Level 4 table, which is essential for memory management.
   - **Kernel Image Base Address (0x0000000030000000)**: Virtual address for the start of the kernel image, which is the main executable code of the kernel.
   - **Kernel Heap and Stack Addresses (0x0000000030100000 - 0x00000000301FFFF0)**: Virtual addresses for the kernel heap and stack, used for dynamic memory allocation and stack operations within the kernel.

3. **User Space:**
   - **User Area Base Address (0x0000000000200000)**: Base virtual address for user-space memory. This is where user applications and processes are typically loaded.

4. **Buffer Memory Regions:**
   - **Frontbuffer and Backbuffer Addresses (0x0000000030200000, 0x0000000030400000)**: Virtual addresses for the front buffer (LFB) and back buffer. These are used for graphical operations and rendering.
   - **Paged Pool and Heap Pool Addresses (0x0000000030600000, 0x0000000030800000)**: Virtual addresses for the paged pool and heap pool, which are used for memory allocation and management.

5. **Additional Heaps and Modules:**
   - **Extra Heaps (0x0000000030A00000 - 0x0000000030E00000)**: Virtual addresses for additional heap spaces, which can be used for various kernel operations and extensions.
   - **Module 0 Addresses (0x0000000030A00000, 0x0000000030A01000)**: Virtual addresses for the first ring0 module and its entry point.

6. **Special Purpose Memory Regions:**
   - **NIC Intel E1000 Address (0x0000000031200000)**: Virtual address for the NIC Intel E1000, used for network operations.
   - **LAPIC and IOAPIC Addresses (0x0000000031400000, 0x0000000031600000)**: Virtual addresses for LAPIC and IOAPIC registers, essential for handling interrupts in multiprocessor systems.
   - **ACPI RSDT Address (0x0000000031800000)**: Virtual address for the ACPI Root System Description Table, used for power management and hardware configuration.

7. **High Memory Regions:**
   - **Windows Pool Start Address (0x100000000)**: Virtual address for the start of the Windows pool, reserved for managing window-related data and operations.

These virtual addresses are carefully allocated to avoid conflicts and 
ensure efficient memory management within the kernel and system. 
They provide a structured layout for various kernel components, user processes, and 
special-purpose memory regions, ensuring that each has a dedicated space in the 
virtual memory map.
