
Let me break this down for you step by step:

The IMCR, or Interrupt Mode Configuration Register, 
is a mechanism used in computer systems to control how interrupt signals 
are routed. Here's a simplified explanation of the text:

1. **Supported I/O Ports:** 
The IMCR can be accessed through two specific Input/Output (I/O) ports:
   - Port `22h`: Used for selecting the IMCR.
   - Port `23h`: Used for writing data to the IMCR.

2. **Accessing the IMCR:** 
   - First, write the value `70h` to port `22h`. 
This action selects the IMCR for configuration.
   - Next, write the desired data value to port `23h`. 
This data defines the configuration.

3. **Default Behavior:** 
Upon powering on the system:
   - The IMCR's value is set to `0`. 
   - In this default state, the NMI (Non-Maskable Interrupt) and 
8259 INTR (Interrupt Request) lines are directly connected 
to the BSP (Bootstrap Processor).

4. **Changing the Configuration:** 
   - Writing the value `01h` to the IMCR modifies 
the routing of these signals. 
   - Instead of being directly connected to the BSP, 
the NMI and 8259 INTR signals are now passed through 
the APIC (Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller).

This functionality is critical for managing how interrupts 
are handled in systems with multiple processors, 
enabling more advanced and flexible configurations.
