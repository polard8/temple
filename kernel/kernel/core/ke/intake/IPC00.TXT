Some notes about IPC created by Copilot.

Hereâ€™s a table to organize all the examples of IPC mechanisms and their associated features for better visualization:

| **IPC Mechanism**               | **Description**                                                        | **Kernel Structure or Management**                                 |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Message Queues**              | Enables processes to exchange messages via a queue.                    | `msqid_ds` for managing queue states and metadata.                 |
| **Shared Memory**               | Allows processes to share a common memory space for data exchange.     | `shmid_ds` structure for segment management and access control.    |
| **Pipes and FIFOs**             | Facilitates unidirectional or named communication between processes.   | Internal pipe buffer for tracking read/write states.               |
| **Sockets**                     | Supports communication between processes over a network or locally.    | Socket buffer (`sockbuf`) for tracking data packets and connection states. |
| **Signals**                     | Sends notifications or alerts between processes.                       | Signal queues and process-specific signal handlers.                |
| **Semaphores/Locks**            | Synchronizes access to shared resources.                               | Semaphore structures maintaining values and waiting lists.         |
| **Named Pipes (FIFOs)**         | Enables communication via named, persistent pipes.                     | Pipe buffer state in the kernel.                                   |
| **RPC (Remote Procedure Call)** | Allows processes to communicate across network boundaries.             | Middleware tracking request/response states.                       |
| **D-Bus**                       | A high-level message bus system for interprocess communication.        | Queues for client connections and subscriptions.                   |
| **Memory-Mapped Files**         | Maps files into process memory for data sharing.                       | File mapping metadata tracked by the kernel.                       |
| **Event Flags**                 | Signals states or events between threads/processes.                    | Kernel event flag structures.                                      |
| **Kernel Queues (kqueues)**     | BSD-specific mechanism for event notification.                         | Tracks pending events and associated handlers.                     |
