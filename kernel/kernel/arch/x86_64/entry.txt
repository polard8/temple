
Here is a summary of the kernel startup flow in the frednora/gramado repository:

Assembly Entry Point:

The entry point of the kernel is defined by the _kernel_begin symbol in arch/x86_64/head_64.asm.
_kernel_begin jumps to the START label.
START Label:

The START label performs some initial setup, such as saving the boot block address and signature.
It then calls _I_kmain using the call _I_kmain instruction.
C Entry Point:

The _I_kmain symbol in the assembly corresponds to the I_kmain() function in the C code 
located in core/kmain/kmain.c.
The I_kmain() function continues the kernel initialization process in C.
