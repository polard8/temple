
 We're passing cmdlines to the child applications via stdin or stderr,
 depending on the type of the child. crt0.c will read one of these files.

 If a child runs in foreground, like terminal, so it receives the cmdline 
 via stdin, otherwise, if the child is not in foreground so, it will receive 
 the cmdline via stderr.
