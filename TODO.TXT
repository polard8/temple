
 List of subsystems in Gramado OS based on the output entity:

 We are working in the concept of subsystems. We don't have 
 a perfect Posix subsystem operating at the moment, but only 
 some similarities.

 Each application can run on it's own conditions, and we're naming 
 the 'subsystem' that represents the environment that makes 
 it possible for the application ro run.

 For now we have the followin list. Che the files APPS.TXT 
 to know more about each one of them.
